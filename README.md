# FundPro
Competitive stock paper-trading website made using Django and Bootstrap. The app allows users to create a portfolio of real, live stocks and trade 1 million fake dollars. If you wanna try it out, go to https://fundpro.herokuapp.com/home/!.

# Brief tech overview
We used Django as our backend framework, Heroku to deploy our project, and Bootstrap for frontend. For live stock info I used Finnhub and yfinance, and Plotly/Pandas to handle stock data

# Why FundPro
Trading stocks is stressful! Some stocks are expensive (I'm looking at you Amazon!). Paper trading allows regular people like you and me to try out stock trading without having to risk our hard earned money while also allowing us to be students of valuation and investing!

# How to Use
Once you've made an account by hitting signup on the home page, using FundPro is quite easy. Use the portfolio tab to monitor the stocks you've bought and sell any. Use the search tab to find stocks, stock info, and to buy stocks. Click the leaderboard tab to monitor other users, and that's about it. I'll leave the heavy investing thinking as an exercise to the reader.
